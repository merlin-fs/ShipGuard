    "changelog": "### Changed\n\n* Updated Burst dependency to version 1.8.13\n* Updated entities packages dependencies\n\n### Fixed\n\n* The entities hierarchy view would sometimes throw exceptions when entities were destroyed.\n* remove use of UNITY_64 define, as is can not be reliably used to determine 64 bit nature of platforms. Fixes crashes related to pointer truncation.\n* The inspector no longer shows stale content when exiting play mode while locked in Authoring mode on a GameObject outside of a subscene.\n* Systems now correctly track the implicit read dependency on enableable components in their queries' `Any` lists. These components are optional, but evaluating a query with optional enableable components requires reading these components' enabled state, which requires a read dependency even if nothing else in the system directly manipulates these types.\n* `EntityManager.SetComponentEnabled<T>(EntityQuery,bool)` now sets the change version for the target type `T` on all affected chunks.\n* `CompanionGameObjectUpdateTransformSystem` expected entities to have the `LocalToWorld` and `CompanionLinkTransform` components, but did not explicitly require them in its query.\n\n### Security\n\n\n### Known Issues"
